## Nashville Hot Heat Index


### Overview
Nashville Hot Heat Index is a single page full CRUD application built with React for the front-end and Python-Django on the back end. This application suggests heat levels for hot chicken orders that match users heat tolerance which is determined on registration. Over time users will rate the many heat levels across Nashville's more popular Hot Chicken restaurants thereby creating an index of averages. For example a medium at Boltons may be the same as xhot Prince’s or the damn hot at Hattie B’s.
